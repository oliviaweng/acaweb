Hello! 
I'm Olivia. 
I'm a sixth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science working with Professor [Ryan Kastner][1] at UC San Diego. 
My research is at the intersection of artificial intelligence and embedded systems.
My work uses hardware-software co-design to create efficient, fault-tolerant computer architectures for neural networks at the edge. 
My PhD was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Before coming to UCSD, I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Professor [Yanjing Li][2] on mitigating cache side-channel attacks and Professor [Andrew A. Chien][3] on integrating SSD latency predictors into cloud systems via hardware accelerators.

* Hardware-software co-design
* Edge neural networks
* Resilient neural networks
* Embedded systems
* Computer architecture
* Hardware accelerators
* Hardware security
* Side-channel attacks
* Shakespeare
* Theater
* Movies
* Film adaptations of books
* Medium specificity
* Novels
* Piano
* Classical music
