Hello! 
I'm Olivia. 
I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science working with Professor [Ryan Kastner][1] at UC San Diego. 
My research focuses on using hardware-software co-design to create efficient, fault-tolerant computer architectures for machine learning. 
My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Before coming to UCSD, I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Professor [Yanjing Li][2] on mitigating cache side-channel attacks while maintaining cache performance and Professor [Andrew A. Chien][3] on integrating SSD latency predictors into cloud systems via hardware accelerators.

My interests include but are not limited to:

* Computer architecture
* Hardware accelerators
* Hardware-software co-design
* Resilient neural networks
* Hardware security
* Side-channel attacks
* Shakespeare
* Theater
* Movies
* Film adaptations of books
* Medium specificity
* Novels
* Classical music
* Opera
* Tennis
* Running
* Tetris
* Traveling
* Taking walks

Talk to me about any of the above, and we will make good conversation!
