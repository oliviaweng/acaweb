Hello! I'm Olivia. I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science working with Professor [Ryan Kastner][1] at UC San Diego. My research centers on computer architecture, focusing on end-of-Moore's-Law computing vis-&agrave;-vis hardware acceleration.

Before coming to UCSD, I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Professor [Yanjing Li][2] on mitigating cache side-channel attacks while maintaining cache performance and Professor [Andrew A. Chien][3] on integrating SSD latency predictors into cloud systems via hardware accelerators.

My interests include but are not limited to:

* Computer architecture
* Hardware accelerators
* Systems for machine learning/Machine learning for systems
* Heterogeneous computing
* Embedded systems
* Hardware security
* Cache side-channel attacks
* Shakespeare
* Theater
* Movies
* Movie adaptations of books
* Medium specificity
* Novels
* Classical music
* Operas
* Tennis
* Taking walks

Talk to me about any of the above, and we will make good conversation!
