      <description>Dear reader, Taking walks after lunch, mostly alone but occasionally with friends, has been one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made in college. I used to approach college with a keep-your-foot-on-the-gas-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-good mentality. Not working was bad and a waste of time. Then the unsustainability of it all hit me around my third year. It was only halfway through the year, and I woke up every day feeling burned out, worn out.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&#39;m Olivia. I&#39;m a first-year PhD student at UC San Diego. My research centers on computer architecture, focusing on end-of-Moore&#39;s-Law computing vis-à-vis hardware acceleration.
  My interests include but are not limited to:
 Computer architecture Hardware accelerators Systems for machine learning/Machine learning for systems Heterogeneous computing Hardware security Cache side-channel attacks Shakespeare Theater Movies Movie adaptations of books Reading novels Classical music Operas Taking walks  Talk to me about any of the above, and we will make good conversation!</description>

      <description>Evaluating Achievable Latency and Cost: SSD Latency Predictors Workshop paper
Abstract. Cutting tail latencies at the millisecond level in internet services for good response times in data-parallel applications is possible by integrating MittOS, an OS/data center interface. Typically, MittOS analyzes white-box information of the internals of devices such as SSD&#39;s and decides if a given server can &amp;ldquo;fast reject&amp;rdquo; a service request. But commercial SSD&#39;s have a black-box design, so MittOS researchers have developed machine learning models to determine if requests to commercial SSD’s can be rejected or not.</description>
